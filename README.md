# HLK-MNT-V2

The HLK-MNT-V2 board is a universal Hi-Link power supply board designed to accommodate various module footprints, including PMxx, 5Mxx, 10Mxx, and 20Mxx series. Measuring 126.19 mm by 48.2 mm and engineered to support up to 6A output on the DC side, it serves as a versatile and powerful solution for embedded applications requiring stable and reliable power.

We've significantly enhanced the original HLK-MNT design with several critical improvements in version 2:

What's New in HLK-MNT v2:

Improved Safety: Added fuse holder, metal oxide varistor (MOV), Littelfuse transient voltage suppression (TVS) diode, and a safety capacitor, providing comprehensive protection on the AC input side.

Enhanced Filtering: Integrated an EMI filter on the AC input side and included a total of four filtering capacitors on the DC output—a premium Panasonic low ESR capacitor accompanied by three Samsung capacitors—ensuring stable and noise-free power.

Flexible Connectivity: The AC input and DC output offer versatile connection options with pads designed to accommodate 5.08mm pitch screw terminals. The DC output allows choosing between using the convenient JST VH connector or screw terminals.

Switch Options: The AC-side switch is now flexible, allowing you to either bridge the pads directly or install 5.08mm pitch screw terminals with a switch according to your requirements.

Enhanced Heat and Noise Management: Added a dedicated ground plane on the DC side with stitching vias to minimize electrical noise and enhance heat dissipation.

Mounting Convenience: Equipped with M3 mounting holes for secure and easy installation.

Ease of Use: Included a clear power LED indicator, making operation status easy to monitor.

These upgrades make the HLK-MNT v2 board a robust, secure, and convenient choice for diverse embedded power supply requirements.
